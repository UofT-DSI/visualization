# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      Bad - Bangladesh Demographic dashboard,1991-2022 - https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/mohammed.amimul.ehasan.shakib/viz/BangladeshPopulation2022Dashboard/PopDashboard
      This graphic aims to visualize the changes in the population density and demographics in Bangladesh by highlighting the change from 1991 to 2022. However, there are pieces of information either missed or poorly represented in the graphics: 
      1. The 2 graphs - Percentage Change in Population (1991â€“2022) and Division Population Trends (1991 VS 2022), do not seem to support each others claim. The former shows a various percentage increase in poplations from various regions in the country ranging from 147% to 850% + increase, but the latter graph shows no regions more than doubling their poplation during the specified time period
      2. The Division Population Trends graph shows no appropriate x axis scale  
      3. There is very limited data related to 1991 - only 1 graph seems to display any data related to that year
      4. The graph Top 5 Districts by population density doesn't offer a parameter (per sq mile or per sq km)

      Good - How Common is Your Birthday? This Visualization Might Surprise You 
      https://thedailyviz.com/2016/09/17/how-common-is-your-birthday-dailyviz/

      This graphic aims to visualize birthdays by individual dates, specifically in the US geography. The visual (heat map) of the calendar makes it very simple to grasp the intended story.
      1. The graph provides an appropriate scale for the colour grading
         


      
      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      Good - How Common is Your Birthday? This Visualization Might Surprise You

      The only major visual I think that could improve this visual is potentially blacking out the 30th/31st of months that do not have those dates. At first glance, July 4th and February 30 & 31st seem to have the same births on average, although the latter 2 days do not exist. The other potential fix is more asthetics related, and starting the gradient heat map at a higher colour. July 4th in particular seems like it is missing it's data, but this is due to contrast/screen brightness. 


      Bad - Bangladesh Demographic dashboard,1991-2022 - https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/mohammed.amimul.ehasan.shakib/viz/BangladeshPopulation2022Dashboard/PopDashboard

      Beyond fixing the previous bad points regarding the data, I think there is data beyond the scope that should be illustrated. 
      1. In anticipation of potential future questions, that data visuals could cover those points easily, and without much additional effort, such as populations growth by gender.
      2. Colour usage can help in better story flow - using a single colour for every region
      3. Adding more comparitive data points in the graphs



      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
