# Acknowledgement

We wish to acknowledge this land on which the University of Toronto operates. For thousands of years it has been the traditional land of the Huron-Wendat, the Seneca, and most recently, the Mississaugas of the Credit River. Today, this meeting place is still the home to many Indigenous people from across Turtle Island and we are grateful to have the opportunity to work on this land.

# Overview of this slide deck

- Explore why we should care about data visualization
- Question what makes ‘good’ data visualization
- Introduce a range of software and tools that are used for data visualization

-------

# Case Study: Why should we care about data visualization?

---

- No matter how good or groundbreaking our data science work is, if we can’t communicate it, its impact will be severely limited.
- Often, the best way to communicate insights from data is in visual format.
- We can see examples of this idea throughout history.

---

- By plotting black bars at the locations of each cholera death, Dr. John Snow was able to provide evidence [tracing an 1854 outbreak](https://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/snowmap1_1854.html) to a specific water pump.

- This visualization is [often cited](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-pro/mapping/something-in-the-water-the-mythology-of-snows-map-of-cholera/) as one of the early origins of the field of epidemiology.

--- 

- This 1858 visualization by Florence Nightingale shows soldiers’ deaths due to wounds in battle (pink), other causes (black), and disease (blue) and was [used to advocate](https://wellcomecollection.org/works/jxwtskzc/items?canvas=7) for prioritizing nutrition, ventilation, and shelter, revolutionizing army medicine.

- Minard, in 1869, visualized: "Figurative Map of the successive losses in men of the French Army in the Russian campaign 1812–1813."

---

# So why visualize information?

- These historical examples gave us different reasons
    - Cholera outbreak → Allows us to see data in context 
    - Nightingale's rose diagram → Presents an argument and advocates
    - Napoleon's Russian Campaign → An example of story telling

---

But data visualization is not always so straightforward...

--- 

# The Challenger Disaster

- In 1986, the space shuttle *Challenger* exploded 73 seconds after launch, killing everyone aboard.

- The explosion occurred because hot propellant gases burned through rubber seals (“O-rings”) on the shuttle’s right solid rocket booster.

- For months, up until the night before the launch, concerns about the O-rings and the safety of the launch had been raised, but launch proceeded anyway

--- 

# The Challenger Disaster - Tufte’s Graph

- In 1997, Edward Tufte famously published a visualization showing the relationship between temperature during launches of test shuttle flights (pre-*Challenger*) and incidents of damage to O-rings (image: Tufte, 1997 👇)

![height:10cm](./images/01_tufte_1997.png)

--- 

# The Challenger Disaster - Tufte’s Graph

- Tufte’s graph seems to show that as launch temperatures decreased, O-ring incident rate increased; thus, by launching at temperatures lower than those tested, NASA unnecessarily endangered _Challenger_ (image: Tufte, 1997 👇)


![90%](./images/01_tufte_1997_arrow.png)

--- 

# The Challenger Disaster - Tufte’s Graph

- Tufte argued that the engineers responsible for communicating the results of the O-ring tests had failed to represent the data that might have saved the crew of _Challenger_.

- Tufte’s graph is used as a classic case study demonstrating the importance of data visualization as a way to communicate complex information.

- Another case of data visualization saving lives?

--- 

## The Challenger Disaster - But...

- The accuracy of Tufte’s visualization has [been](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-319-45193-0_12.pdf) [debated](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11948-002-0033-2.pdf), with Robison identifying several errors in Tufte’s use of data.
- Robison suggests that only one test launch had actually produced relevant O-ring temperature data, producing this visual instead: (image: Robison, 1997, 2002 👇)

![w:800](./images/01_robinson_1997_2002.png)

--- 

# The Challenger Disaster - But...

- Per Tufte, the *Challenger* disaster is a case where good data visualization could have facilitated understanding of complex data and saved lives.

- Per Robison, Tufte’s work is a case of bad data visualization unfairly placing blame and leading the audience to a faulty conclusion.

**The choices we make about visualizing our data have consequences - so how do we make better ones?**
### Activity: What is ‘good’ data visualization?

--- 

# Activity

- Look at the following examples of data visualizations. For each, consider:

    - Is the visualization pleasing to look at?

    - Does the visualization accurately represent data?

    - Can we understand what message the maker of the visualization is attempting to convey?

    - Consider factors such as colour, size, use of images. Is this a ‘good’ data visualization? Why or why not?

# Activity

- Each of the questions corresponds to an important quality of data visualizations:

    - Is the visualization pleasing to look at? → **Aesthetic**

    - Does the visualization accurately and honestly present data? → **Substantive**

    - Can we understand what message the maker of the visualization is attempting to convey? → **Perceptual**

- We need to consider all of these qualities when evaluating and designing ‘good’ data visualizations


--- 

# What data visualization IS

- Dependent on:

    - **Context** → **_where and how_** will our visualization be used? (eg. academic journal, poster, infographic)

    - **Audience** → **_who_** is intended to use our visualization? (eg. subject experts, general public)

    - **Data structure** → **_what_** information do our data capture? (eg. quantities, relationships)

--- 

# What data visualization is NOT

- Hard and fast rules for every situation → **visualizing data means making decisions**

---
