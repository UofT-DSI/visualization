# Data Visualization: Introduction and Overview

```code

# Welcome! 

Introductions and housekeeping

---

# Overview of this slide deck

- Explore why we should care about data visualization
- Question what makes ‘good’ data visualization
- Introduce a range of software and tools that are used for data visualization

---

# Case Study: Why should we care about data visualization?

---

- No matter how good or groundbreaking our data science work is, if we can’t communicate it, its impact will be severely limited.
- Often, the best way to communicate insights from data is in visual format.
- We can see examples of this idea throughout history.

---

- By plotting black bars at the locations of each cholera death, Dr. John Snow was able to provide evidence [tracing an 1854 outbreak](https://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/snow/snowmap1_1854.html) to a specific water pump.

- This visualization is [often cited](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-pro/mapping/something-in-the-water-the-mythology-of-snows-map-of-cholera/) as one of the early origins of the field of epidemiology.

--- 

- This 1858 visualization by Florence Nightingale shows soldiers’ deaths due to wounds in battle (pink), other causes (black), and disease (blue) and was [used to advocate](https://wellcomecollection.org/works/jxwtskzc/items?canvas=7) for prioritizing nutrition, ventilation, and shelter, revolutionizing army medicine.

- Minard, in 1869, visualized: "Figurative Map of the successive losses in men of the French Army in the Russian campaign 1812–1813."

---

# So why visualize information?

- These historical examples gave us different reasons
    - Cholera outbreak → Allows us to see data in context 
    - Nightingale's rose diagram → Presents an argument and advocates
    - Napoleon's Russian Campaign → An example of story telling

---

But data visualization is not always so straightforward...

--- 

# The Challenger Disaster

- In 1986, the space shuttle *Challenger* exploded 73 seconds after launch, killing everyone aboard.

- The explosion occurred because hot propellant gases burned through rubber seals (“O-rings”) on the shuttle’s right solid rocket booster.

- For months, up until the night before the launch, concerns about the O-rings and the safety of the launch had been raised, but launch proceeded anyway

--- 

# The Challenger Disaster - Tufte’s Graph

- In 1997, Edward Tufte famously published a visualization showing the relationship between temperature during launches of test shuttle flights (pre-*Challenger*) and incidents of damage to O-rings (image: Tufte, 1997 👇)

![height:10cm](./images/01_tufte_1997.png)

--- 

# The Challenger Disaster - Tufte’s Graph

- Tufte’s graph seems to show that as launch temperatures decreased, O-ring incident rate increased; thus, by launching at temperatures lower than those tested, NASA unnecessarily endangered _Challenger_ (image: Tufte, 1997 👇)


![90%](./images/01_tufte_1997_arrow.png)

--- 

# The Challenger Disaster - Tufte’s Graph

- Tufte argued that the engineers responsible for communicating the results of the O-ring tests had failed to represent the data that might have saved the crew of _Challenger_.

- Tufte’s graph is used as a classic case study demonstrating the importance of data visualization as a way to communicate complex information.

- Another case of data visualization saving lives?

--- 

## The Challenger Disaster - But...

- The accuracy of Tufte’s visualization has [been](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-319-45193-0_12.pdf) [debated](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11948-002-0033-2.pdf), with Robison identifying several errors in Tufte’s use of data.
- Robison suggests that only one test launch had actually produced relevant O-ring temperature data, producing this visual instead: (image: Robison, 1997, 2002 👇)

![height:10cm](./images/01_robinson_1997_2002.png)

--- 

# The Challenger Disaster - But...

- Per Tufte, the *Challenger* disaster is a case where good data visualization could have facilitated understanding of complex data and saved lives.

- Per Robison, Tufte’s work is a case of bad data visualization unfairly placing blame and leading the audience to a faulty conclusion.

**The choices we make about visualizing our data have consequences - so how do we make better ones?**
### Activity: What is ‘good’ data visualization?

--- 

# Activity

- Look at the following examples of data visualizations. For each, consider:

    - Is the visualization pleasing to look at?

    - Does the visualization accurately represent data?

    - Can we understand what message the maker of the visualization is attempting to convey?

    - Consider factors such as colour, size, use of images. Is this a ‘good’ data visualization? Why or why not?

# Activity

- Each of the questions corresponds to an important quality of data visualizations:

    - Is the visualization pleasing to look at? → **Aesthetic**

    - Does the visualization accurately and honestly present data? → **Substantive**

    - Can we understand what message the maker of the visualization is attempting to convey? → **Perceptual**

- We need to consider all of these qualities when evaluating and designing ‘good’ data visualizations


--- 

# What data visualization IS

- Dependent on:

    - **Context** → **_where and how_** will our visualization be used? (eg. academic journal, poster, infographic)

    - **Audience** → **_who_** is intended to use our visualization? (eg. subject experts, general public)

    - **Data structure** → **_what_** information do our data capture? (eg. quantities, relationships)

--- 

# What data visualization is NOT

- Hard and fast rules for every situation → **visualizing data means making decisions**

---
