# Data Visualization

## Assignment 3: Final Project

### Requirements:
- We will finish this class by giving you the chance to use what you have learned in a practical context, by creating data visualizations from raw data. 
- Choose a dataset of interest from the [City of Torontoâ€™s Open Data Portal](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/) or [Ontarioâ€™s Open Data Catalogue](https://data.ontario.ca/). 
- Using Python and one other data visualization software (Excel or free alternative, Tableau Public, any other tool you prefer), create two distinct visualizations from your dataset of choice.  
- For each visualization, describe and justify: 

# I chose the "Long-Term Energy Plan online survey" dataset because it provides valuable insights into public opinion on energy-related issues, and shaping effective policies. Captures the perspectives of Ontario residents regarding energy priorities, such as renewable energy adoption, cost efficiency, and environmental sustainability.
Itâ€™s a particularly relevant choice because:
# Public Input: It directly reflects the voice of the community, helping policymakers align strategies with the public's expectations and concerns.

# Rich Data: The survey offers diverse categorical and numerical data, making it versatile for creating compelling visualizations to tell meaningful stories.

# Timely and Impactful: In the context of ongoing global challenges like climate change, understanding public attitudes towards energy planning is crucial for developing sustainable solutions.

## *This dataset serves as a bridge between public sentiment and actionable strategies, which makes it both compelling and highly relevant for my project. It allows me to create visuals that not only inform but also inspire action. 
Let's use this solid foundation to make the most of my visualizations!

    > What software did you use to create your data visualization?

# Visualization 1 (Python): Create a bar chart showing survey response distribution across different energy-related questions or categories.

# Visualization 2 (Excel): Construct a pie chart visualizing the percentage of respondents aligned with specific preferences or choices (e.g., renewable energy focus vs. cost efficiency).

    > Who is your intended audience? 

# I think these visualization can hlp Policymakers, environmentalists, energy analysts, and energy analysts, investors in renewable Energy planning and all other related stakholders.
    
    > What information or message are you trying to convey with your visualization? 

# The bar chart (Python) illustrate the frequency or distribution of responses across different categories from the survey. It will help the audience identify trends, preferences.
# The pie chart (Excel) provide a quick visual representation of how respondents prioritize different aspects of the energy plan.
    
    > What design principles (substantive, perceptual, aesthetic) did you consider when making your visualization? How did you apply these principles? With what elements of your plots? 
    
# Substantive: Data clarity, relevance, and accuracy.
Focused on key survey aspects, ensured accurate representation, and omitted unnecessary data.
# Perceptual: Accessibility, contrast, and readability.
Used colorblind-friendly palettes, clear labels, and gridlines for easy comparison in plots.
# Aesthetic: Visual appeal, consistency, and balance.
Maintained harmonious colors, consistent fonts, and clean layouts for professional visuals.

    > How did you ensure that your data visualizations are reproducible? If the tool you used to make your data visualization is not reproducible, how will this impact your data visualization? 
# Ensuring Reproducibility
* Python: Reproducibility is ensured by sharing the complete and well-commented Python code alongside the dataset. Anyone can run the code with the same dataset to recreate the visualization.
* Excel: Excel lacks built-in reproducibility features, but the visualization is shared as an editable file. This allows others to make adjustments or verify the data manually if needed.

If a tool is not inherently reproducible, it may limit the ability of others to validate or modify the visualization efficiently, potentially reducing its reliability. Thus, providing detailed instructions or editable files is essential
    
    > How did you ensure that your data visualization is accessible?  
# Ensuring Accessibility
* Color Choice: Used colorblind-friendly palettes to ensure inclusivity.
* Readable Text: Applied clear, legible fonts and appropriately sized labels.
* Annotations: Added clear titles, legends, and data point labels for context and to reduce reliance on interpretive guesswork.
* Alternative Formats: Provided editable files (e.g., Excel files) and reproducible Python code to allow others to modify or explore the visualizations in a way that suits their needs.
* Simple Design: Avoided cluttered visuals by maintaining proper spacing and focusing on key information to enhance understanding for all users.

    > Who are the individuals and communities who might be impacted by your visualization?  
# Policymakers: can guide energy policy decisions by providing insights into public preferences and trends.
# Environmental Advocates: The data can help environmentalists promote renewable energy strategies based on public support.
# General Public: Insights can raise awareness about energy issues, enabling informed discussions and engagement.
# Energy Providers: Companies can tailor energy programs or offerings based on public expectations.
# Future Generations: Decisions influenced by the surveyâ€™s results may lead to more sustainable and equitable energy solutions.

    > How did you choose which features of your chosen dataset to include or exclude from your visualization? 
# Relevance: Included survey response categories and data directly addressing the assignment's objective, such as preferences for energy priorities or renewable energy adoption.
# Clarity: Focused on features that are simple to interpret and convey meaningful insights, excluding overly granular or redundant data points.
# Completeness: Selected features with consistent and comprehensive data entries, avoiding incomplete or missing data fields.
# Impact: Prioritized features that highlight key public opinions, making the visualizations impactful for the audience.

    > What â€˜underwater labourâ€™ contributed to your final data visualization product?

* Data Cleaning: Removed irrelevant data, fixed missing values, and standardized formatting.
* Preprocessing: Aggregated responses and created derived metrics (e.g., percentages).
* Tool Setup: Configured libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Seaborn) and ensured Excel readiness.
* Experimentation: Tested various techniques and documented with clear code comments.
 
- This assignment is intentionally open-ended - you are free to create static or dynamic data visualizations, maps, or whatever form of data visualization you think best communicates your information to your audience of choice! 
- Total word count should not exceed **(as a maximum) 1000 words** 
 
### Why am I doing this assignment?:  
- This ongoing assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes: 
* Create and customize data visualizations from start to finish in Python
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story  
- This would be a great project to include in your GitHub Portfolio â€“ put in the effort to make it something worthy of showing prospective employers!
