# Data Visualization

## Assignment 3: Final Project

### Requirements:
- We will finish this class by giving you the chance to use what you have learned in a practical context, by creating data visualizations from raw data. 
- Choose a dataset of interest from the [City of Torontoâ€™s Open Data Portal](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/) or [Ontarioâ€™s Open Data Catalogue](https://data.ontario.ca/). 
- Using Python and one other data visualization software (Excel or free alternative, Tableau Public, any other tool you prefer), create two distinct visualizations from your dataset of choice.

- For each visualization, describe and justify: 
    > What software did you use to create your data visualization?
    I used RStudio to create my product.  

    > Who is your intended audience? 
    The intended audience for this product is policy analysts at the Ontario Ministry of Labor to inform their policy formation and decision-making. 

    > What information or message are you trying to convey with your visualization? 
    The narrative change in the labor market is shifting from labor shortage to employee support.
    
    > What aspects of design did you consider when making your visualization? How did you apply them? With what elements of your plots? 
    Deliver the labor market shift through data and evidence by leveraging the visual evidence instead of text description.
    
    > How did you ensure that your data visualizations are reproducible? If the tool you used to make your data visualization is not reproducible, how will this impact your data visualization? 
    The data product is reproducible because the main architecutre is embedded in the codes. Should the reproduction is required, then the dataset need to be replaced only.
    
    > How did you ensure that your data visualization is accessible?  
    I ensured the accessibility of this data product by making available in the ministry internal BI page. Also, color and other design principles were integrated into the product.

    > Who are the individuals and communities who might be impacted by your visualization?  
    The internal stakeholders are policy makers in the ministry. The external stakeholders are interest groups among employee support organizations. The altimate target of this product is the employees in Ontario.
    
    > How did you choose which features of your chosen dataset to include or exclude from your visualization? 
    The dataset came from Statistics Canada. StatsCan datasets are common sources within my unit. 
    
    > What â€˜underwater labourâ€™ contributed to your final data visualization product?
    I am not sure what this question mean. Please clarify.

- This assignment is intentionally open-ended - you are free to create static or dynamic data visualizations, maps, or whatever form of data visualization you think best communicates your information to your audience of choice! 
- Total word count should not exceed **(as a maximum) 1000 words** 
 
### Why am I doing this assignment?:  
- This ongoing assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes: 
* Create and customize data visualizations from start to finish in Python
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story  
- This would be a great project to include in your GitHub Portfolio â€“ put in the effort to make it something worthy of showing prospective employers!
