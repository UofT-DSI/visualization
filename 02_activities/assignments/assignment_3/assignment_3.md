# Data Visualization

## Assignment 3: Final Project

### Requirements:

- We will finish this class by giving you the chance to use what you have learned in a practical context, by creating data visualizations from raw data.
- Choose a dataset of interest from the [City of Toronto’s Open Data Portal](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/) or [Ontario’s Open Data Catalogue](https://data.ontario.ca/).
- Using Python and one other data visualization software (Excel or free alternative, Tableau Public, any other tool you prefer), create two distinct visualizations from your dataset of choice.
- For each visualization, describe and justify:

  > What software did you use to create your data visualization?
  > I used seaborn and tableau desktop to create the data visualizations.

  > Who is your intended audience?
  > Healthcare professionals and stakeholders

  > What information or message are you trying to convey with your visualization?
  > Dataset exploration - to see if age plays a role in the amount of people who have heart disease based on the dataset

  > What aspects of design did you consider when making your visualization? How did you apply them? With what elements of your plots?
  > I considered the purpose and audience of the data visualization, chart type, visual hierarchy, color and contrast, encoding choices, labels, legends, and annotations. I also took accessibility into account maing sure the color contrast scores are high and texts/labels are legible.

  > How did you ensure that your data visualizations are reproducible? If the tool you used to make your data visualization is not reproducible, how will this impact your data visualization?

In python, I used a random seed to ensure sampling would yield the same results.
In Tableau, the visualization is not reproducible. Reasearchers interested in verifying the authenticity of the data visualization would not be able to inspect and reproduce the visualization. This leads to less trust in the authenticity of the visualization.

> How did you ensure that your data visualization is accessible?
> I used legible text, and ensured that the color contrast score was high.

> Who are the individuals and communities who might be impacted by your visualization?
> Healthcare researchers, professionals, and stakeholders.

> How did you choose which features of your chosen dataset to include or exclude from your visualization?
> This decision was made based on already known data and the purpose of the visualization. The message I was trying to pass across.

> What ‘underwater labour’ contributed to your final data visualization product?
> The underwater labour behind my visualization included cleaning the dataset to remove missing values, experimenting with different plot types to find the most informative one, and refining the labels and color palette so the audience could easily interpret the relationship. These steps aren’t visible in the final chart, but they were crucial to making it accurate and clear. Also, the data scientist who curated the data.

- This assignment is intentionally open-ended - you are free to create static or dynamic data visualizations, maps, or whatever form of data visualization you think best communicates your information to your audience of choice!
- Total word count should not exceed **(as a maximum) 1000 words**

### Why am I doing this assignment?:

- This ongoing assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes:

* Create and customize data visualizations from start to finish in Python
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story

- This would be a great project to include in your GitHub Portfolio – put in the effort to make it something worthy of showing prospective employers!
