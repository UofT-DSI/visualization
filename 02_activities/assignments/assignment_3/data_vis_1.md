# Age Distribution by Heart Disease Status

This bar plot visualizes the relationship between age and heart disease status in the dataset. Key features of the visualization:

- The x-axis shows two categories: patients without heart disease (0) and patients with heart disease (1)
- The y-axis represents the age of patients
- Each bar shows the mean age for each group
- The error bars represent the 95% confidence interval around the mean
- Using seaborn's darkgrid style for better readability
- Colors are automatically assigned to distinguish between the two groups
- Legend is removed to avoid redundancy since the x-axis labels provide the same information

This visualization helps us quickly understand if there's an age difference between patients with and without heart disease.
