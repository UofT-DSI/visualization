# H1 Visualization 2: Type of police incidents in Toronto

This graph shows the type of incidents involving use of force by Toronto police officers. We can see that violent calls for service form the biggest chunk of cases which seems logical. However, the second biggest proportion of police incidents involve calls about people in crisis where use of force seems less appropriate.

- For each visualization, describe and justify: 
    > What software did you use to create your data visualization?
        Excel
    > Who is your intended audience? 
        General public of Toronto and other Canadians
    > What information or message are you trying to convey with your visualization? 
        This graph highlights that calls for people in crisis should be attended by healthcare professionals so that the use of police force could be reduced where unnecessary. 
    > What aspects of design did you consider when making your visualization? How did you apply them? With what elements of your plots? 
        I wanted the graph to be clear and professional, given the serious nature of the subject. So I used plain blue and black colors in the bar graph, which is easily interpretable by most people.
    > How did you ensure that your data visualizations are reproducible? If the tool you used to make your data visualization is not reproducible, how will this impact your data visualization? 
        The visualizations are not reproducible since I used Excel. It is harder for someone else to replicate or verify my work, thus it reduces the credibility of this graph. 
    > How did you ensure that your data visualization is accessible?  
        The graph uses a blue color chosen to be suitable for individuals with color blindness. It has font size large enough to be readable. 
    > Who are the individuals and communities who might be impacted by your visualization?  
        General public of Toronto and other Canadians. This could have an impact on people suffering from mental illness or their close ones. 
    > How did you choose which features of your chosen dataset to include or exclude from your visualization? 
        I chose to keep it simple and focus on the type of incidents alone to highlight the need to consider alternative ways of dealing with mental health crises. 
    > What ‘underwater labour’ contributed to your final data visualization product?
     This data was collected and coded by many different administrative and police employees in the city, as well as the people impacted by it.
