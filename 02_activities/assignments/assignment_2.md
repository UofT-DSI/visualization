# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
     [ The visualization 1](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/vizgrowth/viz/Formula12024LapTimesBeeswarm/Beeswarm) looks to be a bad one due to a few reasons:
     1. It is hard to say what the visualization is trying to say to us, the message is not clear enough.
     2. The data is shown only if you click on one of the dots, which still doesn't give us much info.
     3. Colouring of the dots is also confusing and blending one into another.
     4. No info about y-axes.

     [The visualization 2](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/chimdi.nwosu/viz/MakeoverMonday2025Wk26-LifeExpectancyin2025/Dashboard1) seems to be a good one:
     1. It has a few sections with a brief explanation about the subject of the section.
     2. It has aesthetic, visual is nice and well structured.
     3. Data seems to be represented accurately, so we can call it substantive.
     4. The message of the visualization is clear, it's a perceptual one.
     5. Source for data seems to be reliable. 
     6. It also shows data per each region for the included countries.


      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      1. As for the first visualization:
     - I would probably suggest using another method of visual to represent it and make it a bit more structured, but that is my view only.
     - If sticking to the same method, then providing a bit more details for deciphering the visualization would be great: such as what the picture is showing us, any hint for what we can use this data for and what colouring means.
     - I would suggest adjust method of showing x-axes and y-axes for more clarify of what we are looking at.
     - Also, apart from the existing visualization adding some grouped statistics into it could also be beneficial for better perception. 


     2. The second visualization:
     - Setting a specific label with age range for the colour scale for life expectancy for better clarify.
     - Adding possibility to select a specific regions or countries while clicking on a specific colour on this scale. So other regions can be greyed out.
     - Adding global average data into visualization for better comparison.
     - It would be also more beneficial if data for a some previous years were added to see a continues trend of life expectancy over years.
      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)

### Why am I doing this assignment?:

- This assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story
