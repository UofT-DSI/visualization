# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.

    Visualization Overview

    The chart shows:
    1. Life expectancy at birth by continent and country (2025 data).
    2. A color gradient from red (younger life expectancy) to blue (older life expectancy).
    3. A dot plot and world map combined.

    Why I feel this visualization Is Considered Bad: 
    1. Color Choice and Accessibility
        The red-to-blue gradient looks appealing but is not uniform- it's difficult for users (especially those with vision issues) to interpret subtle differences.

    2. Dark background + dark colors 
        The dark colors and dark background reduces the readability, especially for smaller dots or text.

    3. Poor Labeling and Context
        Although the map and dot plot includes the numeric scales on scroll, viewers can't easily tell what specific life expectancy values the colors represent. 
        The data doesn't include any overall information about the minimum, average and maximom life expectancy for the whole world.

    4. Overcrowded and Redundant Information
        The dot plot duplicates the information shown on the map but doesn't add much insight. The visualization tries to do too much at once- compare continents and show a global map - which splits viewer attention.

    5. Map Ineffectiveness
        The world map uses color saturation to show life expectancy, but this can be misleading: 
            Small countries are nearly invisible.
            Large landmasses (e.g., Russia, Canada) dominate visual attention even if their data isn't extreme.
            The legend linking color intensity to numeric life expectancy is open ended, so the color meaning is ambiguous.

    6. Lack of Data Clarity
        The title Life Expectancy at Birth • 2025 • In Years • By Country gives context, but the visualization doesn't show actual numbers or ranges (e.g., 50 - 85 years).
        Users can't extract quantitative insights, only a vague sense of younger vs. older.

    - How could this data visualization have been improved?

        How It Could Be Improved

        1. Use a consistent color palette (e.g., light-to-dark blue) that’s colorblind-safe.
        2. Add numeric scales or legends for both plots.
        3. Simplify to 1-2  visual (include a combination chart (bar chart + line graph)  by continent , a global map with the same interactive tooltips).
        4. Use higher contrast and lighter background will help in enhancing readability.



    Good visualization Reference:
    https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/valerie.madojemu/viz/ShopifyOverviewRAWNutritionConcept/ShopifyOverview

    Visualization overview:
        1. This dashboard provides an overview of RAW Nutrition’s Shopify performance, highlighting key metrics like profit (£4.64M), revenue (£8.09M), and customer retention (66%).
        2. It breaks down profit by product category and tracks trends over time, showing Protein as the top contributor.
        3. Additional visuals display social media session data and the top five products by profit for 2025.

    What’s Good About This Visualization

        1. Clear structure and hierarchy
            The layout is well-organized: KPIs at the top, supporting charts below.
            Each section answers a distinct business question (profit trends, product breakdowns, customer behavior).

        2. Key Metrics are prominently displayed
            Top summary tiles (Profit, Revenue, Orders Fulfilled, Returning Customer Rate) give a snapshot of performance with YoY changes.
            Colors are consistent and professional- grey and black palette keeps the focus on data.
        
        3. Good use of interactivity
            Parameter Control and Toggle Top/Bottom 5 options enhances user exploration.
            Filters let users view data by product category and metric.

        4. Effective chart types
            Bar chart for product category profit comparison- clear and easy to read.
            Line chart for profit trends over time- shows trend over the quaters and peak performance periods (e.g., December spike).
            Combined chart for sessions and conversion rate- dual-axis presentation works well.

        5. Consistent labeling and currency formatting
            All values are properly labeled (e.g., 4.64M, 8.09M), which aids readability.  

      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
