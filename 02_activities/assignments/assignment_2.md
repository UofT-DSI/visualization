# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
    **Visualization 1 - good example:** [Cyber attacks by sector, region and country](https://www.moodys.com/web/en/us/insights/data-stories/10-key-insurers-risks-in-charts.html)
      [Click to open image.](https://iibawards-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/projects/images/000/007/224/large.jpg?1741584290)

      * great use of color
      * shows message clearly
      * is interactive and probably reproducible

    **Visualization 2 - bad example:** [AMD Ryzen 5 5500X3D CPU Benchmark - Chromium code compile](https://gamersnexus.net/cpus/am4-lives-amd-ryzen-5-5500x3d-cpu-review-benchmarks)

      [Click to open image.](https://gamersnexus.net/u/styles/large_responsive_no_watermark_/public/inline-images/GN%20CPU%20Benchmark%20_%20Chromium%20Code%20Compile%20%28Windows%29%20_%20GamersNexus-4x_foolhardy_Remacri_7.png.webp)

      While this cannot be called an outright bad example of a bar chart, I decided to put these benchmark results for a CPU review for the following reason: to be more critical of what I am used to. I've gotten used to constantly seeing this kind of charts in the past 25 years due to my interest in computer hardware. So I will be treating it as a bad example to deal with my interest bias of automatically considering a PC hardware chart to be a good visualization example!

      - It's hard to see the CPU in question in the list. While it can be highlighted by animation in a review video in editing software, an article chart should probably include the CPU in question (AMD R5 5500X3D) highlighted. Source: 01_course_intro slide.
      - While the chart says that lower values are better, that part should be highlighted more. It's something that consumers always want to know while glancing at a chart. Source: 01_course_intro slide.
      - Ideally, this should not be a picture, but an interactive web element for reproducibility. GamersNexus already have the results in their database according to [their testing methodology](https://gamersnexus.net/features/living-doc-current-test-bench-hardware-list-methodologies). If these were not just pictures, but web elements like at [NotebookCheck.net](https://www.notebookcheck.net/AMD-Ryzen-5-5600X-Processor-Benchmarks-and-Specs.508454.0.html), it would improve reproducibility for their team.
    

    **Visualization 3 - bonus example:** Wage earners vs unemployed - US Labor Pool for Defense - 1940.
      [Image](https://datavizproject.com/wp-content/uploads/examples/Sk%C3%A6rmbillede-2016-02-01-kl.-18.48.23.png)
      
      * It's apparently from 1940! Therefore, it's hard to call it a bad example, as it's probably ahead of its time.
      * Lack of legend other than upper/lower bars. It's hard to see what exactly the chart is trying to convey right away.
      * It does not look exactly reproducible.
      * It looks nice, even now. Good use of colors and styles.



      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
    **Visualization 1 - **
      * show the key message right away before interacting
      * have a header


      **Visualization 2 - **
      * use colors to differentiate product manufacturers and the tested CPU
      * show Lower is Better more clearly

      **Visualization 3 - ** 
      * Add legend elements
      * Highlight the message clearly

      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)

### Why am I doing this assignment?:

- This assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story
