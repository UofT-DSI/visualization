# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 

        BAD EXAMPLE
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      The bad example I chose was a pie chart out of 178% published by WCVB Channel 5 Boston. The original image isn't available at the source. However, it is available at this link by Utah State University: https://www.usu.edu/math/symanzik/talks/2021_SouthwestMichiganChapter.pdf
      This is a bad graph because:
      -The sections of a pie chart should total 100%.
      -It doesn't mention the sample size of the people surveyed. 
      -The decription of the three categories is unclear upon first glance and it might take the reader a while to understand what "getting it" means. 

      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
    To depict this data and allow for the reader to make a comparison across the three categories, it would have been better to show this data in the form of a bar graph instead. In addition to addressing the issues I mentioned with the graph above. 

      
       GOOD EXAMPLE
    Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.

    For my good example, I chose Figure 4. Age and gender distribution of COVID-19 in Canada. Available at https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/current-situation.html

    -This graph is easy to understand upon first glance. 
    -It specifies what the sample size is and doesn't just present percentages, but also the raw numbers for each category.
    -The information is clearly presented with a simple font and simple colors that do not distract the reader. 

      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      -The notes highlight where the data were obtained from and several assumptions that were made. 
      -While it is understandable why these assumptions were made and that these notes were added to a separate section in the interest of saving space, the data visualization should have included a short footnote asking the reader to view the notes section to ensure that the layperson doesn't misunderstand the graph. 
      -I would have also bolded the font so that it doesn't require one to strain their eyes as much. 

      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)

### Why am I doing this assignment?:

- This assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story
