# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      Good visualization: http://dadaviz.com/i/1160
      This heat map is easy to read and pleasing to look at. 
      It also contains enough context to understand the visualization and the data is represented clearly and accurately. 
      The visualization can be interpreted in many ways depending on which part of the graph the audience focuses on, but because the visualization is so clear, the message can be easily understood regardless of the interpretation. 
      
      Bad visualization: http://www.citylab.com/tech/2014/02/mapping-where-people-run/8313/
      This flow map is not pleasing to look at because it is messy, especially where the flow lines converge.  
      It also does not give enough details of the data represented in the graph, therefore the audience cannot assess the accuracy of the data. For instance, we do not know what the purple lines represent.
      It is unclear what message the visualization is meant to convey because context is missing to understand the graph. 
      
      The three qualities asthetic, substantive, and perceptual were used to classify the visualizations (content from lesson 1 material)
      
      ```
      
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      Good visualization: This visualization is already pretty clear. One way it could be improved is maybe add some visual clues to help the audience focus on the main message. 
      For example, a box or arrow can be use to point to the square the author wants to highlight, thus helping to convey the main message. 
      It might also be helpful to include a total number of games represented by the graph to provide more context to the data (each box represented as percentages). 
      
      Bad visualization: This visualization can be improved by adding some text legends to help the audience understand what is being represented here. 
      For example, text legend can explain that the purple lines reprensent the run routes runners take from the chosen exercise tracking app. 
      The visualization should also include information such as which city it is and the difference between the thin and thick lines
      Furthermore, to convey the main message that "people really do love running near water and in parks", it could be helpful to highlight bodies of water and parks in the map. 
      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)

### Why am I doing this assignment?:

- This assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story
