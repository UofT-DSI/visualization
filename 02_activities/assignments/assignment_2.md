# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```

##  Good Visualization Example  
**Source**: [Covid-19 Vaccination Dashboard â€“ Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/shailendhra.venkat/viz/Covid-19VaccinationDashboard_16391002140220/CovidVaccinationDashboard) :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

### Why I classified this visualization as good:
1. **Appropriate chart selection**  
   It combines maps, bar charts, and line plots to represent different aspects of vaccination data, following the principle of matching visualization types to data types from our lectures.
2. **Clean and accessible layout**  
   With clear headers, legends, and consistent formatting, it supports perceptual clarity and ease of navigationâ€”aligned with information design principles.
3. **Interactive features**  
   Filters and hover tooltips allow users to explore by country, vaccine type, and timeline. This enhances equity and accessibility in data exploration.
4. **Minimal chart junk**  
   The dashboard avoids unnecessary embellishments, maintaining focus on the dataâ€”demonstrating good use of data-ink ratio (Tufte, 1983).
5. **Contextual labeling**  
   Captions, axis labels, and legends are all present, helping users understand what is being shown without needing backstory.

## Bad Visualization Example  
**Title**: Angular Gauge Chart â€“ Speedometer Style  
**Source**: [https://medium.com/@e0032148/data-viz-gauge-chart-bdba8ac4fcb9](https://medium.com/@e0032148/data-viz-gauge-chart-bdba8ac4fcb9)
### Why I classified this visualization as bad:
1. **Hard to read precisely**  
   The needle and arc rely on estimating angles, which is perceptually weaker than comparing lengths or positions. Viewers canâ€™t easily gauge small differences (Cleveland & McGill, 1984).
2. **Low data density**  
   The chart only shows one metric without allowing comparisons or trends. It fails to convey meaningful relationships between multiple values or over time.
3. **Visual distortion**  
   The arc length does not proportionally reflect numeric values. For example, 75% often looks more than 1.5x as large as 50%, which visually exaggerates differences.
4. **Inefficient use of space**  
   The circular format takes up significant real estate on a dashboard to display a single value, violating the principle of effective data-ink use.
5. **Emotional bias**  
   The speedometer aesthetic can cause users to overreact to moderate changesâ€”especially when red/yellow color scales are used without justification.

    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      Your answer...
## Good Visualization Example
- **Add annotations for events**: Mark key moments (e.g. vaccine approvals) on the time series to build narrative context.
- **Include uncertainty bands**: Show confidence intervals or report delays to communicate data reliability clearly.
- **Improve accessibility**: Use color-blind-safe palettes and provide alt text for screen readers to reach a wider audience.

## Bad Visualization Example 
- Replace with a **bar chart** or **bullet chart** to show the metric linearly.
- Include **exact numeric labels** to remove ambiguity.
- Add **comparative benchmarks** (e.g., targets, thresholds).
- Use **neutral, accessible color schemes**, and avoid red unless the value truly represents danger.
- If multiple metrics are needed, use **small multiples of bars** instead of stacked gauges.

      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)

### Why am I doing this assignment?:

- This assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story
