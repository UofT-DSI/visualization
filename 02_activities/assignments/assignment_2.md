# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.

    1. Bad visualization 
     
As an example of a bad visualization, I have chosen a diagram illustrating money remittances between countries that exceed USD 1 billion (InfoCaptor, n.d.). This type of graph is called the chord diagram; it looks like a circle with pairs of data points connected by arcs (DataVizProject, n.d.). Although it is somewhat appealing visually, here are a few reasons why I think this type of graph is not very effective at conveying useful information. 
- It is quite hard to understand what is on the graph without at least some level of understanding of these types of graphs. This type of graph is rarely used, and as discussed in class, rare graph types can increase viewers‚Äô cognitive load. 
- Next, we discussed that ‚ÄúWhat data is the user seeing?‚Äù is a key question. On this graph, some information is easier to understand than some other information. For example, it is clear that the USA amounts to a major share of the graph, but understanding how the designers visualize the connections between countries (the choice of marks, channels and encoding) is not always easy, especially with thinner lines.  
- As discussed in Gerend (2023), this type of graph only represents pairwise relationships, which may be limiting. In this case, it may be interesting to see clusters of countries (e.g. with most connections between them) rather than pairwise relationships. 
- This type of graph is probably not optimal for large datasets. it seems that by using a threshold of USD1 billion, the designers attempted to fit as many countries are possible into the graph, which leads to a cognitive overload. 
- Finally, the choice of colours is suboptimal. As discussed in class, the choice of colour can help provide visual popout, but in this case there are too many colours on the graph, and some colours are duplicated.
How could this visualization be improved? Although it may be challenging to present these specific data coherently on one graph, Miles (2019) suggests a solution. Without significantly altering the presentation, it is possible to essentially create multiple "mini-graphs" instead of one big graph. This may entail:
- Creating nodes that show multiple links between countries;
- Combining the nodes into groups with different sizes and colour-coding, and; 
- Prioritizing more significant connections, for example by using more prominent colours of lines (Miles, 2019).

  2. Good visualization 

As a good example, I have chosen a diagram showing typical March snowfall volumes in three American cities to illustrate the abnormality of record March 2015 snowfalls in each of them (Enten, 2015). The visualization is a scatterplot that shows years of observation on the x-axis and inches of snowfall on the y-axis. The graph is both elegant and visually appealing, and informative as it is easy to see the information that it is trying to convey without a cognitive overload. 
-	A scatterplot is a type of graph that is used often and is relatively easy to understand compared to the previous example. 
-	The visualization has a rectangular shape which helps improve the readability and appeal of the graph. 
-	Answering the question ‚ÄúWhat data is the user seeing?‚Äù, the title clearly suggests that each dot is a separate snowfall event. 
-	Next, the graph is clearly separated into 3 sections, one for each city. Thus, the use of both vertical and horizontal space makes it possible to compare the cities directly on one graph, and do so in a meaningful way. And that in spite of a large number of observations visualized on the graph. 
-	Only one colour is used, and only shading (from dark to light blue) is used to convey different values. 
-	Transparency enables the viewer to see where the dots (marks) overlap. 
-	A dotted trend line with a number (in inches, in bold font) shows where the current snowfall is compared to the March norm. 
I think this graph is almost perfect. It would be hard to suggest improvements, but if I had to do that, I would suggest two possible changes: 
-	Improving the choice of marks, channels and encoding, e.g. by emphasizing outliers such as record snowfalls in a different colour to provide visual popup. This needs to be done carefully; as discussed in class, too many colours could distract the viewers and create clutter. 
-	Adding a simple legend to explain why the graph uses different shades of blue.

- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
