# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      BAD VISUALIZATION 
      A visualization that could use some inprovements is found here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/gurpreet.singh2669/viz/OceanHealth_16951858845800/OceahHealth

      It is confusing for several reasons 
      
      Complexity of Information Resulting in High Cognitive Load:
        Multiple charts, maps, and data points are presented simultaneously without clear separation. Although the relationship between them is clear. 

      Lack of Clear Labels and Legends:
        The way the legend of "Debris Collected" is represented is confusing when reviewing the geographical location the samples were collected from because the colors do not match. Ambiguous labels make it hard to interpret what each visual element represents, leading to confusion about data meaning.

        Also, legends for interactive units are not easily foundable. They are built in diresctly into the interactive units. 
      
    
      A few ways to improve the visualization: 
      - Simplify the layout by focusing on key metrics.
      - Use consistent color schemes with explanatory legends.
      - Provide clear labels and descriptions.
      - Offer guidance or instructions for interactive features.

    GOOD VISUALIZATION 

    Source founs here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/health.care.cost.institute/viz/Opioid10YearTrendsBlogInteractiveTool070919/Figure210YearTrends

    The dashboard provides an interactive overview of opioid trends in United States over a ten-year period. It include various charts and graphs that display data such as overdose rates, prescription trends and geographic breakdowns based on state.  

    The design employs a clear layout, with visual distinctions between different data visyalization types, making it easy to navigate and interpret the information. The colors used are mostly logical and support differentiation between categories, aiding in quick overvieww. 

    Interactive filters are very useful and allow users to normalize data, explore trends across different regions and focus on specific states.

    A few ways to potenatilly improve: 
    - Add demographic breakdown 
    - Add timefrme filters 

- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)

### Why am I doing this assignment?:

- This assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story
