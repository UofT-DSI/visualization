# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.

        ## Effective Visualization Example

            **Title:** [How Common Is Your Birthday?](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lisa.trescott/viz/HowCommonIsYourBirthday_17222664505560/Birthday)  
            **Author:** Lisa Trescott  
            **Link:** [https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lisa.trescott/viz/HowCommonIsYourBirthday_17222664505560/Birthday](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lisa.trescott/viz/HowCommonIsYourBirthday_17222664505560/Birthday)  

        **Description:**  
        A radial calendar chart showing the rank and frequency of each birthday in the U.S. over a 20-year period. The use of intuitive layout, clear labeling, and color encoding makes this a strong example of effective visual communication.

        **Why it is effective:**  
           This visualization is effective because it presents a large dataset in a format that feels both intuitive and engaging. The radial calendar design reinforces the cyclical nature of the data, making the visual structure align well with the concept of birthdays throughout the year‚Äîa good example of matching form to purpose ([4]). The consistent use of a single-color scale helps the viewer interpret frequency at a glance without overwhelming them, which aligns with perceptual clarity principles emphasized in evaluating visual encodings ([4]). The framing question, ‚ÄúHow common is your birthday?‚Äù, sets a clear rhetorical direction for the viewer, reflecting the idea that visualizations are communicative and persuasive tools ([1]; [4]). Additionally, the interactive tooltips enhance accessibility and interpretation without cluttering the layout.


        **How it could be improved:**

           While the overall presentation is strong, there are small ways it could be improved. A visible color legend would make the frequency scale clearer, especially if the chart is viewed in a static or printed format. In addition, a brief explanation of why certain dates show lower birth counts‚Äîfor instance, holidays‚Äîwould provide helpful context and strengthen audience understanding ([4]). Finally, because the circular layout might be difficult to navigate on smaller screens, offering an alternate layout for mobile users could improve accessibility ([4]).

        ### Less Effective Visualization Example

            **Title:** Global CO2 Dashboard ‚Äì Powered by Tableau Agent  
            **Author:** Harim Jung  
            **Link:** [https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/harim.jung/viz/GlobalCODashboardPoweredbyTableauAgent/TableauAgentClimateDashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/harim.jung/viz/GlobalCODashboardPoweredbyTableauAgent/TableauAgentClimateDashboard)  
        
        **Description:**  
        A dense multi-panel dashboard combining radial bar charts, small time-series plots, and bubble charts to communicate global CO‚ÇÇ statistics by country and over time. While ambitious in scope, the complexity of layout, overuse of chart types, and minimal narrative structure hinder interpretability.
       
       **Why it is  ineffective:**
            This dashboard attempts to present a global overview of carbon emissions, but the sheer volume of visual elements makes it difficult to extract meaningful insights. The circular bar chart, while visually striking, lacks precision and is hard to read, especially when comparing values across segments ([4]). Many of the smaller charts are cramped, using inconsistent scales and labels, which adds cognitive strain rather than simplifying the story ([4]). The dashboard does not guide the user toward key takeaways and lacks a clear visual hierarchy ([4]).


        **How it could be improved:**
            With some refinement, this visualization could become more effective. Replacing the radial chart with a more straightforward format like a horizontal bar chart would improve comparison ([4]). Grouping similar metrics together and reducing the number of competing visuals would enhance clarity ([4]). Additionally, adding a stronger narrative structure‚Äîsuch as clear section headings or guided annotations‚Äîcould help guide the viewer through the insights in a more digestible and focused manner ([1]).
