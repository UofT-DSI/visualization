# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      GOOD EXAMPLE:
      https://www.informationisbeautifulawards.com/showcase/378-history-of-the-fifa-world-cup  

      It is pleasing to look at
      It accurately represents data
      The information is understandable
      The use of colours to display the data (number of goals) is very effective
      It gives data over many years that can easily be compared over time 
      It provides A LOT of data but in an organized not messy way that is not difficult to read
      The bar plot with the different colours for goals scored on each stage of the tournament makes the information easy and quick to read







      BAD EXAMPLE:
      https://oberhaeuser.info/project/mer-14
      It's not easy to quickly see what information the graph is showing
      The use of 3-d'ish shapes and the bars on top of one another makes the graph look messy and cluttered. 
      There is no title/label (of the graph itself). You have to read the rest of the page to understand what it is plotting.
      The value of the bar printed where it is, makes the reader have to scroll up and down to find the number. 
      There is no consistency in the height of the bar for the same value (ie, 3 bars have a value of one, but they're all different sizes)


      How could this data visualization have been improved? 

      Could keep the rounded bars but not have them overlap (provide more space horizontally) or use a thinner bar
      Could order them by value from smallest to largest
      Could have the x-values all at the bottom (not on the bars) maybe, or if ordered they might look ok on the bars themselves
      Could have the y-values (numbers) on the y- axis
      Could have a title of ehat we're actually looking at.









      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)

### Why am I doing this assignment?:

- This assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story

### Rubric:

| Component               | Scoring   | Requirement                                                 |
|-------------------------|-----------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Data viz classification and justification | Complete/Incomplete | - Data viz are clearly classified as good or bad<br />- At least three reasons for each classification are provided<br />- Reasoning is supported by course content or scholarly sources |
| Suggested improvements  | Complete/Incomplete | - At least two suggestions for improvement<br />- Suggestions are supported by course content or scholarly sources |
