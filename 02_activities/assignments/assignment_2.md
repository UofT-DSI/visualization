# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      Bad: https://datavizproject.com/data-type/arc-diagram/ (least to most relevant defect arc diagram)
      Good: https://datavizproject.com/data-type/bar-chart/ (industry experience vs years in role bar chart)

      The good graph:
      - clearly conveying information: each data point is labelled and each graph has a title to state their intentions, making it clear to see what the 2 different graphs mean and how they may relate to each other.
      - effective use of design: each bar is labelled a different color to differentiate from one and other. For example, industry experience is categorized in 3 different categories, with 0-3 years, 4-10 years and over 10 years, each one has a different color, making it easy to distinguish in between. Similar method was applied. Although one thing I would suggest changing here is to have the categories to be of the same length (there are 3 categories for the left graph and 4 for the right)
      - accurate representation: all bars add up to 100% and each bar height is scaled accordingly, the accurate height makes it easy to see at first glance the highest and lowest categories

      The bad digram:
      - cluttered: feels a bit complicated and there are too many lines connecting between elements that it makes it hard to read at first glance, the lines are also really hard to see against the background
      - missing info: this particular diagram is missing a title making it hard to know what it's showing, there's no legend explaning the different colors, scale, actual relevance (in numbers) or why the lines are connected, making it very difficult to interpret the illustration. Some words in the legend may also be abbreviations, so it would be helpful to expand on those
      - misleading: the lines on the right are more exagerrated but I don't think they're more important than the ones to the left of the digram, which may be misleading to the reader without looking more into the diagram

      ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      For the bad diagram:
      - increase clarity: start by adding a title (perhaps 'relevance between medical recall and defects')and a legend (not sure right now what the differnet colors mean), it would be beneficial to explain what the actual relevance # is found to be between the categories
      - reduce clutter: consider increading readability by splitting the diagram in two if neceessary, since the left side of the diagram doesn't seem to be interacting with the right side, consider having 2 graphs to represent the groups of data. Also consider using more color scales, right now it's very hard to track the different colors across the illustrations since they're similar color groups

      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)

### Why am I doing this assignment?:
