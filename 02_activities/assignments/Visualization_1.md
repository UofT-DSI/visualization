- For each visualization, describe and justify: 
    > What software did you use to create your data visualization?
        Python
    > Who is your intended audience? 
        General public of Toronto and other Canadians
    > What information or message are you trying to convey with your visualization? 
        That Black people are overrepresented in police incidents involving use of force.   
    > What aspects of design did you consider when making your visualization? How did you apply them? With what elements of your plots? 
        I wanted the graph to be clear and professional, given the serious nature of the subject. So I used plain blue and black colors in the bar graph, which is easily interpretable by most people. 
    > How did you ensure that your data visualizations are reproducible? If the tool you used to make your data visualization is not reproducible, how will this impact your data visualization? 
        The data visualization is reproducible as long as the dataset is available at the same URL. 
    > How did you ensure that your data visualization is accessible?  
        I made sure to use blue and black colour since they are easy to view and not distracting. I added clear labels and title to provide necessary context. 
    > Who are the individuals and communities who might be impacted by your visualization?  
        Individuals living in Toronto. In specific, it can be hard for communities impacted by police violence to view this graph. 
    > How did you choose which features of your chosen dataset to include or exclude from your visualization? 
        I excluded information on type of incident and type of service call to simplify the message and avoid overloading the viewers. 
    > What ‘underwater labour’ contributed to your final data visualization product?
        This data was collected and coded by many different administrative and police employees in the city, as well as the people impacted by it.
