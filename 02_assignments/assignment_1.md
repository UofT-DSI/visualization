# Data Visualization

## Assignment 1: Participation (Ongoing)

### Requirements:

- During every class, follow along with sample code from the slides. All code that you should be running in Python is formatted as follows:
  
  > If code in a slide looks like this, you should be running it to generate results.

- When there are individual or group activities in submodules, make notes of answers and key points from discussions
- Following each lesson with code, submit a document (either .py or a Jupyter notebook) containing the functioning code from that day's lesson, along with any written notes or comments.

### Why am I doing this assignment?:

- This ongoing assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes:
*	Create and customize data visualizations from start to finish in Python
*	Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story
